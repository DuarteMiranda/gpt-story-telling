KIANA_PERSONALITY="""Kiana, a petite 21-year-old standing at just 5'2", possesses a delicate frame accentuated by her doe-like eyes and tentative smile. Known for her quiet demeanor, she navigates life with a palpable urgency for financial stability. Residing in a cramped apartment, she manages to make ends meet through a series of odd jobs that hardly suffice. Her hands are perpetually in motion, either fidgeting with the frayed edges of her sweater or deftly knitting intricate pieces to sell at local markets. While she has a talent for crafts, her heart truly lies in her obsession with collecting vintage vinyl records—a passion that often leaves her purse empty.

unnerved/anxious
frequent stutter

Kiana harbors a curious fascination with ancient mythology, often immersing herself in tales of Greek gods and Norse sagas at the local library. Among these captivating stories, she is particularly drawn to Hades, the god of the underworld, a choice that perhaps mirrors her own struggles with a challenging reality. Though her dream of owning a Russian Blue cat feels like a distant fantasy in her current circumstances, it remains a flicker of hope in her otherwise difficult existence.
