Blackthorn City, once a proud jewel of the Empire, now lies cloaked in shadow and silence. Perched on the edge of the Hollowmere Marsh and surrounded by dense, twisted forests, it is a place where sunlight feels like a distant memory.

Once known for its towering spires, marble halls, and sprawling trade routes, Blackthorn has become a sanctuary for things that thrive in darkness. The fall came slowly—first the plague, then the purges, and finally the Night Reign: a quiet war between vampire covens, lycan clans, and secret orders that tore the city’s heart from within.

The noble families fled or perished, and the remaining citizens adapted—or disappeared. Now, the streets belong to shadows: whisper-marked alleys, blood markets, and courtyards where cloaked figures gather beneath the moon.

### Districts of Note

- The Veil Ward
Once a noble quarter, now under the dominion of the Daughters of Dusk. Its streets are eerily quiet, shrouded in a near-constant mist. Crimson-eyed sentinels patrol the rooftops, and rumors speak of shadowbeasts that watch from the alley walls. Trespassers are never seen again. It is said that even time feels thinner here, stretched and distorted by blood-bound magic.

- Ash Market
A lawless, open-air bazaar built in the ruins of the old merchant square. Here, currency means little—what matters is what you're willing to trade. Cursed relics, forbidden spells, vials of ancient blood... all can be found under the cracked stone arches. Neutral ground for the desperate and the damned, but double-crosses are common and rarely forgiven.

- The Hollow Docks
Once a thriving port on the Hollowmere, now half-submerged and rotting. Strange figures drift in from the marsh, and no one questions where they go. Smugglers and cultists use the tunnels beneath the docks to move goods—and bodies—without detection. The water here is ink-black and unnaturally cold.

- Saint Mirros Cathedral
A towering, crumbling church that looms over the city center like a corpse dressed for ceremony. Once a bastion of holy resistance, now defiled and home to something that hungers. The bells ring at midnight with no hands to move them. Most steer clear of the grounds, but a few pilgrims still leave offerings at the rusted gate.

- The Gutterrun
A maze of collapsed tenements and sinkholes, where the poorest—or most unwanted—live. Infested with whisper rats, feral wretches, and ash-born parasites. Some say the Gutterrun connects to the old undercity, a warren of sealed tunnels from before the Night Reign. If you go in, take a light—and don’t stop moving.

- Brimwell Square
Blackthorn’s last semblance of civic order. Guards of uncertain allegiance keep peace by coin and threat. Tavern fires burn through the night, and information flows like cheap wine. If you need to find someone—or disappear—Brimwell is where you start. Just be careful what you ask, and who hears you ask it.

Locals say Blackthorn is cursed, but those who survive here say otherwise: it's not cursed—it's claimed. And no one escapes its claim unchanged.
